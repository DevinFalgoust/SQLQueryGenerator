SQLQueryGenerator
==========

This is a simple program created to generate a large amount of test SQL Queries very quickly.
It currently only has the Insert Query Generator implemented, but I can potentially create
more Query Generators as the need arises.

Instructions on how to use this are included in the Driver.java file

A class in this project (InsertQueryGenerator) includes the randomAlphabetic function from 
org.apache.commons.lang3.RandomStringUtils
You can either go download this from the Apache Commons website and add it to your Build Path,
or write your own random string generation function.
