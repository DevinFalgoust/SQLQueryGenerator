SQLQueryGenerator
==========

This is a simple program created to generate a large amount of test SQL Queries very quickly.
Currently only the Insert Query Generator is completely implemented.

The Select Query Generator has its basic functionality built, but is not feature complete.
It currently does not support the OR operator, the BETWEEN or IN operators, multiple values in
a given where clause, and it currently does not provide type safety on any where operators.

Instructions on how to use this are included in the Driver.java file

A class in this project (InsertQueryGenerator) includes the randomAlphabetic function from 
org.apache.commons.lang3.RandomStringUtils
You can either go download this from the Apache Commons website and add it to your Build Path,
or write your own random string generation function.
